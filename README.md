In this epic SCARY game, you're a security guard working the night shift at Gloopy Goo's Pizzaria, with one main problem... you have a severe gambling problem. Survive from midnight to 6 AM by:

- Monitoring security cameras to track animatronic cats
- Using door controls and lights to check for and block threats

# REFLECTION 

**WHAT DID YOU BUILD?**
- I built a Five Night's at Freddy's clone that implemented my FAVORITE things: cats... and gambling ðŸ¤‘ðŸ¤‘ðŸ¤‘ðŸŽ°ðŸŽ°ðŸŽ°

**WHAT LANGUAGES OR TOOLS DID YOU USE?**
- I used JavaScript, HTML, and CSS!!!!!!

**WHICH AI TOOLS DID YOU USE, AND HOW?**
- I used two AI tools, Claude and Grok. I used Claude to help get the foundations of the game correctly so that I could go in and manually tweak it once the groundwork was layed and continue to build ontop of the existing base. I used Grok to troubleshoot and do some last minute touch ups (mainly just cause my Claude quota ran out).

**WHAT DID YOU DO VERSUS WHAT AI HELPED WITH?**
- AI helped me turn the barebones ideas I had into a working game, and with the core mechanics functioning (for the most part) I went in and manually added customization proccesses and tweaked different values and mechanics to make sure that the game functioned exactly as I wanted it to.

**WHAT'S ONE THING YOU'RE PROUD OF?**
- Uh.... erm.... hmm...... I suppose I'm proud that it's a working product because I honestly realized as I had 10 minutes left to complete it that I didn't follow the reasonable scope proccess so I was scrambling to get it finished so I'm just proud that it works.

**WHAT'S ONE THING YOU'D IMPROVE WITH MORE TIME?**
- I'd improve the visuals a lot more because the mechanics of the game work a lot more, I just would want to polish it up and make the UI elements more appealing and add the sounds I didn't have enough time to add in.
